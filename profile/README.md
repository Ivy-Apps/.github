# Welcome to Ivy Apps 
**We build innovative and easy-to-use apps that matter.**

## Ideology :earth_africa:

We believe that people _(not only corporations)_ can create innovative, open-source,
and free software that can make the world a better place.

**We want Ivy to be:**

- A place where you can excel and have fun while contributing to something meaningful.
- A community where you can express yourself freely and build the future that you want to live in.

**We believe in:**

- Freedom.
- Creativity & Innovation.
- Challenging the status quo.
- Having the right to do what you believe in, not what you're told to.
