## Ideology :earth_africa:

We believe that people _(not corporations or business entities)_ can create innovative, open-source,
and free software that can make the world a better place.

**We want Ivy to be:**

- A place where you can excel and have fun while contributing to something meaningful.
- A community where you can express yourself freely and build the future that you want to live in.
- An open-source project that'll inspire a movement where people can build the software they want
  and eventually become a DAO where hundreds of developers can work on their own terms.

**We believe in:**

- Freedom.
- Creativity & Innovation.
- Challenging the status quo.
- Decentralization.
- Having the right to do what you believe in, not what you're told to.
